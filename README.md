# Implement a design from scratch
## headphones

### This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. I implemented the design from scrtach without importing any external CSS framework or library. I did not use Javascript. I only used my knowledge  of HTML, CSS, Accessibility/Responsive design, acquired in course of the alx Intro to Software Engineering Program, to build it.
